Thank you for wanting to contribute to this repository!

# Before Contributing
1) Ask the professor of the course if they feel comfortable with their presentations / submissions to the homework they prepared etc. being freely published on the internet.
2) Learn about 'how to make a pull request on github' by simply googling it ([e.g.](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&client=ubuntu&q=how+to+make+a+pull+request+github))
3) Make your changes on the correct path!

* If you are a professor / content creator and you want to give people permission for sharing your content, please make a pull request similar to [this example / template](https://github.com/batikanor/tgu-archive/blob/main/permissions/BATIKAN-BORA-ORMANCI.md) at the same path.

* If you are a student and you've gotten permission from a content creator for sharing their content, please make a pull request similar to [this example / template](https://github.com/batikanor/tgu-archive/blob/main/permissions/BATIKAN-BORA-ORMANCI.md) at the same path. (E.g. if you've asked them via email, just write so. Please don't lie, otherwise you'll be held responsible for lying, for it isn't the nicest thing you could do :( ...)

* If you are going to share some content, make sure that anyone that may have any right on that content has a file on them on the /permissions/ path, and the permissions they've given (at least seemingly) include the content you're about to publish.
